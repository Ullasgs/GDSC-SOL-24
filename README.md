Abstract:
Crop yield is severely threatened by animal
invasion, which has consequences for both food security and
farmer income. This suggested model details how this issue
might be addressed via the integration of IoT and ML
methods. As image processing and Internet of Things (IoT)
sensor monitoring network technologies have advanced,
sensors have undergone radical changes. Animal-human
conflict is a serious issue in the agricultural sector and the
forest zone, posing a threat to human life and causing
significant material loss. Wireless sensors can analyze video
clips from a gathered dataset to create an animal incursion
detection system. This study introduces Invariant Feature
Extraction (IFE) using SlowFast architecture. The videos are
annotated first, and then the IFE model is used to extract the
spatial data. Classifying animals based on their pictures, can
keep better tabs on them. Accidents involving animals and
vehicles may be avoided, animals can be traced, and theft
can be avoided if detection and categorization methods are
used. The efficient deep learning techniques are helpful for
this.



INTRO:
The incursion of animals
into an agricultural field is a major cause of crop failure
nowadays. It seems like this animal against farmer
confrontation is happening more and more often in the
area. Farmers lose a lot of money, especially in hill station
areas and those close to forests. They have tried
Hellikites, shotguns, strings and stones, electric welding mesh fences, and other modern and traditional means to
combat this problem, but thus yet, nothing has worked as
well as hoped.Improved future
decision-making begins with interpretation or facts, such
as examples, a prior model, or recommendations. The
primary goal is to let computers learn and improve
themselves with little human intervention or oversight

Farmers and the government alike are feeling the effects of this issue. As a result, farmers
can't rely on the profits from high-yield crops like rice and
wheat during the non-monsoon months [11]. Finally, the
government must compensate the farmers. There is an
urgent need for an intelligent monitoring system with no
human required to automatically distinguish the entering
animal and inform the farmer [12], since the rudimentary
remedies implemented in the villages have not been able
to eliminate the issue fully. Recent years have seen a rise
in the need for developing automation systems, notably in
the field of animal incursion detection. In order to thrive,
every growing animal species need a specific habitat,
which often consists of a single kind or range of flora.
Tigers and elephants, for example, need more space in
which to live [13]. Because of this, wild animals have few
resources remaining, and these systems often come into
touch with human settlements, resulting in encounters
among people and animals. Human population increase,
altered land use, development, and the loss of habitat are
all potential root causes of human-animal interactions.
Therefore, a protective mechanism is proposed that
detects the arrival of wild animals into the field and
generates a tolerable amount of discomfort for the
animals. 
























ABSTRACT

The study proposes a model to address crop yield threats from animal invasion, focusing on the integration of IoT and machine learning methods. The model uses  Invariant Feature Extraction (IFE) using SlowFast architecture to analyze video clips and create an animal incursion detection system. This approach can help prevent accidents, trace animals, and theft, using efficient deep learning techniques.The integration of IoT and ML methods can address animal invasion threats to crop yield and farmer income.This method can classify animals based on their pictures, preventing accidents, tracing animals, and theft. Efficient deep learning techniques can further enhance this system.

INTRODUCTION
Over 60% of the Indian population relies on farming for their livelihoods, with an anticipated 15-20% growth in food commodities over the next five years. However, many people working in this field lack the confidence they need to make it their primary source of income. Factors such as environment, seed selection, fertilizer inputs, irrigation, and other factors may account for the observed variation in crop yields from farm to farm. The incursion of animals into agricultural fields is a major cause of crop failure, and farmers lose a lot of money, especially in hill station areas and those close to forests.

AIoT is an effort to resolve this tension by using technologies like IoT and Machine Learning. Machine learning allows machines to teach themselves via experience rather than being explicitly taught. The primary goal is to let computers learn and improve themselves with little human intervention or oversight. CNNs are a type of deep neural networks that are often used for examining visual pictures, and their accuracy has set new marks for a number of critical tasks. CNNs find use in areas such as medical image processing, computer vision, recognition of images and videos, and recommendation systems.

Invasion by wild animals is a major issue in parts of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Uttarakhand, particularly those bordering forests. Farmers and the government alike are feeling the effects of this issue, as they cannot rely on the profits from high-yield crops like rice and wheat during non-monsoon months. There is an urgent need for an intelligent monitoring system with no human required to automatically distinguish the entering animal and inform the farmer.

Recent years have seen a rise in the need for developing automation systems, particularly in the field of animal incursion detection. A protective mechanism is proposed that detects the arrival of wild animals into the field and generates a tolerable amount of discomfort for the animals. In this study, a SlowFast-architected IFE model for terrestrial animal identification is presented.
